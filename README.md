# FBLA Mobile App Development Project

We were mainly tasked with creating an educational app over anything (within the scope of normal education) <br>
Requirements:

- quizzes
- puzzles

We decided to use react native as our framework and library, which we then will use expo and snacks within react native to create a mobile application covering vaious topics within "World History"
